1. Go to https://github.com/users/adrozdenko/projects/2
2. Click on the Status field dropdown
3. Edit field options:
   - Rename "Todo" to "Backlog" (Gray)

   - Keep "In Progress" (Blue)
   - Add "In Review" option (Purple)
   - Keep "Done" (Green)

### Step 2: Add Priority Field
1. Click "+ Add field" button

## üéØ **Board Views**

Create these custom views:

- Sort by: Priority, then Creation date

### **2. Epic Overview**
